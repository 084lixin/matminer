# Contributing to matminer
We love your input! We want to make contributing to matminer as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:\
* Reporting a bug
* Discussing the current state of the code
* Submitting a fix
* Proposing new features
* Becoming a maintainer

### We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use the [Github flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)).

## Making a Pull Request
The basic procedure for making a PR is:
* Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
* Commit your improvements to your branch and push to your Github fork (repo).
* When you're finished, go to your fork and make a Pull Request. It will automatically update if you need to make further changes.

### How to Make a **Great** Pull Request
Keeping an expanding, open-source codebase readable and maintainable is hard; for this reason, we have a few tips for writing good PRs:

* Use the Google Code style for all of your code. Find an example [here.](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html)
* Your code should have (4) spaces instead of tabs.
* If needed, update the documentation.
* **Write tests** for new features! Good tests are 100%, absolutely necessary for good code. We use the python `unittest` framework -- see some of the other tests in this repo for examples, or ee the [Hitchhiker's guide to python](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/tests/) for some good resources on writing good tests.
* Understand your contributions will fall under the same license as this repo. 

When you submit your PR, our CI service will automatically run your tests. 
We welcome good discussion on the best ways to write your code, and the comments on your PR are an excellent area for discussion.


### Reporting bugs, getting help, and discussion
The first place to go is the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/matminer). Start a new topic, and then read the next section if you are making a bug report.

### Bug reports
Great Bug Reports tend to have:
* A quick summary and/or background
* Steps to reproduce
* Be specific!
* Give sample code if you can. My stackoverflow question includes sample code that anyone with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
* What you expected would happen
* What actually happens
* Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
We love thorough bug reports.
