We train a machine learning (ML) model on previously reported observations, parameters from physiochemical theories, and make it synthesis method{\\textendash}dependent to guide high-throughput (HiTp) experiments to find a new system of metallic glasses in the Co-V-Zr ternary. Experimental observations are in good agreement with the predictions of the model, but there are quantitative discrepancies in the precise compositions predicted. We use these discrepancies to retrain the ML model. The refined model has significantly improved accuracy not only for the Co-V-Zr system but also across all other available validation data. We then use the refined model to guide the discovery of metallic glasses in two additional previously unreported ternaries. Although our approach of iterative use of ML and HiTp experiments has guided us to rapid discovery of three new glass-forming systems, it has also provided us with a quantitatively accurate, synthesis method{\\textendash}sensitive predictor for metallic glasses that improves performance with use and thus promises to greatly accelerate discovery of many new metallic glasses. We believe that this discovery paradigm is applicable to a wider range of materials and should prove equally powerful for other materials and properties that are synthesis path{\\textendash}dependent and that current physiochemical theories find challenging to predict.},\nURL = {http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/4/eaaq1566},\neprint = {http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/4/eaaq1566.full.pdf},\njournal = {Science Advances}\n}"

However, detailed experimental phonon spectra are available only for a limited number of materials which hinders the large-scale analysis of vibrational properties and their derived quantities. In this work, we perform ab initio calculations of the full phonon dispersion and vibrational density of states for 1521 semiconductor compounds in the harmonic approximation based on density functional perturbation theory. The data is collected along with derived dielectric and thermodynamic properties. We present the procedure used to obtain the results, the details of the provided database and a validation based on the comparison with experimental data.}, publisher={figshare}, author={Petretto, Guido and Dwaraknath, Shyam and Miranda, Henrique P.
