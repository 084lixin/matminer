MatMiner
========

MatMiner is an open-source Python library for performing data mining and analysis in the field of Materials Science. It is meant to make accessible the application of state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning algorithms to materials science data with just a *few* lines of code. It is currently in development, however it is a **working code**.

Citing MatMiner
--------

We are currently in the process of revising the first draft of a paper on MatMiner, so be on the lookout for a paper with the following cite structure::

    Bajaj, S.; Jain, A.; [MatMiner]

Overview
--------

It includes tools and utilities that make it easier to,

- Retrieve data from the biggest materials databases, such as the `Materials Project <https://www.materialsproject.org/>`_ and `Citrine's databases <https://citrination.com/>`_, in a Pandas dataframe format
- Decorate the dataframe with composition, structural, and/or band structure descriptors/features
- Solve for and add thermal and mechanical properties to the dataframe




To cite MatMiner, you can cite the following two papers::
